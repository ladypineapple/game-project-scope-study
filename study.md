class.

Submit detailed answers to the following in this file via a pull request:

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.

-   The data structure you plan to use.
I suppose arrays.

-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS.
I plan to build using the same order that we've built our lessons in class. Starting with the basic HTML elemenents --> Ajax and APIs.

-   How you plan to approach this project.
I plan to approach this project using project management tools in my past life that help in terms scheduling, prioritizing, and goal setting. I am going to tackle this in chunks and get the pieces I am most comfortable done as quickly as possible so that I can build my confidence and give myself a lot of time on the challenging portions.

-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
As a <new user> I want to <register> so that I can <log in>
As a <registered user> I want to <log in> so that I can <start a game>
As a <registered user> I want to <open a game> so that I can <make a move>
As a <registered user> I want to <select a logo> so that I can <mark the board>
As a <registered user> I want to <mark the board> so that I can <take my turn>
As a <registered user> I want to <clear the board> so that I can <play a new game>
As a <registered user> I want to <view my profile> so that I can <see my games>
As a <registered user> I want to <change my password> so that I can <log in>

-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
Building in order as I mentioned above, and also for giving myself time twice a day that is only for reading and formatting my own code.

-   What creative spin will you add to your project?
Since it's the first project and I know I'm going to lose sleep over functionality I am going to focus on giving it some very pretty very clean CSS that focuses on creating continuity with typefaces and color schemes. I want to focus on create aesthetic flow without overwhelming myself. If I have the time I want to put in some silly x's and o's.

-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?
I'm gonna git the fork out of my code. Or maybe fork the git out of it?

Planning on building out a project guideline excel to clock hours, keep track of my git repository, progress goals and issues as I work.

-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?
I'm trying to submit a game that works by Monday. If I have time for bonuses I would love to add mobile capabilities. But that will be what I at the end, if time allows for it.

You may want to submit pictures for your wireframes and/or user stories.
